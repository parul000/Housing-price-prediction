# Housing-price-prediction

This project aims to find the features which affect the house prices in US nationally. 

We have used the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a proxy for home prices [link](fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA)

For start, we have taken 6 features (GDP, Mortgage Rate, Unemployment Rate, Federal Funds Rate, Personal Consumption Expenditure, House supply months) into consideration to see their effect on the house prices.
